## Principles

Write tests first
- Writing your tests first helps to prevent **over-engineering** a solution and provides a suite or regression tests to prevent breaking existing functionality.

TDD
- Development **driven** by tests producing just enough design.
- *Overengineering* occurs when code is made pointlessly adaptive - that is, it can be extended in ways that it will never need.
- Without becoming a domain expert in the field, you need a design tool that will guide you through the process of capturing labyrinthine requirements in working, verified code.
- Class, responsability, and collaboration (CSC) design sessions.

## Patterns

### Builder pattern

- Clarifies unit test intent, functional domain-specific language (DSL) 
- Reduces repetitive setup code
